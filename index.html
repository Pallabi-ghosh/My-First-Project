        <h2>FIRST PROJECT</h2>
        <h4>Project Description</h4>
        <p>My first project was MY CARD. I made this in Sketch. It was showing expensess in your phone app. I named it
          SPENDO. In the cards section you can see how much you have spent in a hole month or a year. It's very useful
          to stay upto-date with your expenses. I made a prototype of this. </p>

        <h2>SECOND PROJECT</h2>
        <h4>Project Description</h4>
        <p>My second project was the continuation of my first project. In my first project was to show card expenses,
          but in my second project I continued with the expenses. There are the details of expenses such as in which
          category are you spending. Every time when you are using you card it can show how much money you have spent
          category wise.</p>

        very versatile and enthusiastic individual from India living in Denmark . I have been looking for new
        opportunities where I can utilise my determination , can-do attitude and show my flexibility. Before moving to

          since last 6 months ,as I have been very much interested in learning UX/UI design. I am learning the art of
